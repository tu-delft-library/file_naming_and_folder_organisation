    Why should you care about Storage Structures?
  </div>
</center><br>

In the previous section of this module, we explored how to name your files and organise folders. We learned that proper file naming and organisation are not just good habits; they are critical skills for any student or future researcher. Knowing where your files are and being able to visualise their organisation ensures you can quickly retrieve information, maintain data integrity, and save time when managing software or data projects or preserving crucial documents.

    Why does the directory tree matter in programming?
  </div>
</center><br>

From a computational perspective, understanding how files are structured within a directory tree enhances your ability to navigate file systems efficiently and ensures organised, accessible, and secure data management. A directory tree is a hierarchical structure representing the organisation of files and directories (also called folders) within a computer's file system, starting from a root directory and branching out into various subdirectories. The file system manages this hierarchy, organising data into files (which hold information) and directories (or folders) that contain files or other directories.

## 4b. Directory Tree (how are the drives on a computer organised):

    What is a Directory Tree (also known as Tree Directory or Directory)?
  </div>
</center><br>

Let's break down the concept of a directory tree using a simple analogy: imagine a directory tree as a family tree. Just as a family tree starts with a common ancestor and branches out to show different family members, a directory tree starts with a single "root" and branches out to show various directories and subdirectories, each containing files or additional directories.

- <b>The Root Node:</b> This is the top-most directory in the hierarchy, and it’s the starting point for all directories and files on your computer. Everything branches off from here. Just like the topmost ancestor (such as a grandparent), it is the starting point for the family tree. On Windows, the root directory is represented as ‘C:\’, and on Unix-based systems like macOS or Linux, it’s represented as ‘/’.

- <b>Parent Nodes:</b> Moving down from the root in a family tree, you have family members (parents) who are directly connected to the ancestor and have their own children. Similarly, in a directory tree, <b>parent nodes</b> represent directories that contain other directories or files.

- <b>Child Nodes:</b> In a family tree, children branch off from their parents. Similarly, in a directory tree, <b>child nodes</b> are directories or files within a parent directory. A child node can either be a subdirectory or a file. And so, child nodes, that are subdirectories, can themeselves become parent nodes of other files and directories beneath them in the tree. 

- <b>Leaf Nodes (End Members):</b> In a family tree, the individuals who do not have children of their own are like <b>leaf nodes</b> in a directory tree. Leaf nodes are typically files because they do not contain any further subdirectories or files. They are the endpoints of the tree, representing actual content, such as documents, images, or videos.

You might wonder: <b>What's the difference between a directory tree and folder structure?</b> In summary, a directory tree is used by operating systems (such as Windows) to manage the entire file system organisation. Meanwhile, a folder structure focuses on practical organisation for a specific purpose or project. Both concepts help us manage and navigate our digital content effectively.

<b>Scenario:</b>

To better understand what a directory tree is, let’s look at how the file system is organised on a scientist Nelle’s computer.

<center>

</center>

The file system resembles an upside-down tree, with the root directory represented by a slash character ```/``` on the top; this character is the leading slash in ```/Users/nelle```. Inside that directory are several other directories: bin (to store built-in programs), data (for miscellaneous data files), Users (where users’ personal directories are located), tmp (for temporary files that don’t need to be stored long-term), and so on. These directories are the child nodes of ```/```, the root node.

We know that our current working directory ```/Users/nelle``` is stored inside ```/Users>``` because ```/Users``` is the first part of its name. Similarly, we know that ```/Users``` is stored inside the root directory ```/``` because its name begins with ```/```. The subdirectories ```/Users/nelle``` is a child node of ```/Users```, which is itself a child of ```/```.

Notice that there are two meanings for the ```/``` character. When it appears at the front of a file or directory name, it refers to the root directory. When it appears inside a path, it’s just a separator.

Underneath ```/Users```, we find one directory for each user with an account on Nelle’s machine, her colleagues Imhotep and Larry.

The subdirectory ```/Users``` is the parent node to ```/Users/imhotep```, ```/Users/larry```, and ```/Users/nelle```, and it is the child node of ```/```, the root directory.
